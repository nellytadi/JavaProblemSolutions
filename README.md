# Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software and Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data
These repo shows projects worked on while taking the courses Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software and Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data 
on coursera. 

It includes algorithm design implementations including writing appropraite tests for
solving several problems like writing programs that 
access and transform images, websites, and other types of data.
Also, writing programs that encrypts and decrypts text using Ceasar Cipher Algorithm and Vigenere Algorithm.
